# Chatroom
A local area network chatroom I wrote in python.

## Description 

This is a chatroom repository consisting of two scripts, server.py and client.py. 

### Executing program

Run the server.py file to start listening for connections. Then run client.py from the terminal in this order (python, client.py, IP, PORT). Enter a name for yourself, and BOOM! you're in.
